# SpinK Tutorial

## Part I: Introduction

### PROMELA
- PROMELA is the input language for SPIN model checker.
- PROMELA & SPIN tandem is widely used for specifying & verifying concurrent systems.
    - e.g., cryptographic protocols, LINUX FUTEX, Flight Guidence Systems
- PORMELA has a similar syntax to C:
    - e.g., variable assignment, goto statements, control structures (if, do, etc.)
- However PROMELA is a high-level **modeling language**, unlike C.
    - It abstracts away low-level implementation details.
    - It is not suitable for direct implementation of systems.

### Limitation of SPIN

### Deductive Verification
